# Interview Scheduler

## Scheduler

The Scheduler Project is a Single Page App using React. Some react hooks such as useState, useEffect and useReducer were used. The app is also using Websockets allowing data to be synced from a browser to another without refresh.

The main focus was on testing. `Webpack`, `Jest`, `Storybook` and `Cypress` were used to allow unit testing, integrated testing and end-to-end testing.
